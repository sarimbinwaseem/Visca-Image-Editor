Making a Python based image editor with login and multithreading.

### For first time, paste in command prompt or git CLI:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarimbinwaseem/Visca-Image-Editor.git
```
### After that when some changes you made:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "write what you have contributed or changed."
git push --all
```
there is a dot at the end of command: ```git add .```

### And most importantly, whenever you want to start working:
```bash
git pull origin main
